# Computational_Vocab

Target audience:Game/level design

I think that computational thinking is a great tool for level design because of just how large the scope of the projects can be that you need a way to be able to process and get through it all. My answer to that is computational thinking. It has really useful principles like abstraction that help you to really focus on the project and not on unimportant details. There s also pattern recognition which is� pretty important in level design because depending on the type of patterns you set up in your level it can really affect how the player views/interacts with the level. Then there s of course decomposition which to me is the most important� because there s so many things that can go into a level that you could get� overwhelmed if you don t do the process of decomposition.�
